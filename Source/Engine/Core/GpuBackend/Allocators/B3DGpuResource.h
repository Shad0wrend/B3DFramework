	 * eventually drops to zero, OnWillDestroy() fires exactly once and the manager frees the resource.
	 *
	 * @par Threading
	 *
	 * Notify* may be called from queue-submission threads. Deferred-destroy fires on the thread that
	 * decrements the bound count to zero. Callers do not need to take external locks.
