		 * Reads data from a buffer while accounting for the fact that the buffer might not be directly CPU-readable. Only buffers with
		 * StoreOnCPUWithGPUAccess flag, or staging read buffers are directly readable by the CPU. And only in the case they are not currently being
		 * used by the GPU.
		 *
		 * If a buffer is being used by the GPU, or is not directly CPU-readable, this method will internally create a staging buffer, copy the source
		 * buffer into the staging buffer using the provided GPU queue, and then read the data from the staging buffer. If no GPU queue is provided,
		 * it will use the default graphics queue.
		 *
		 * Note if the buffer is currently used on the GPU, this method will block until the GPU is done executing, stalling the pipeline.
		 *
		 * @param	buffer			Buffer to read from.
		 * @param	offset			Offset in bytes from which to copy the data.
		 * @param	length			Length of the area you want to copy, in bytes.
		 * @param	destination		Destination buffer large enough to store the read data. Data is written from the start of the buffer (@p offset is only applied to the source).
		 * @param	commandBuffer	Command buffer on which to encode the staging buffer copy, in case the buffer is not directly readable. If not provided
		 *							the operation will be queued on a transfer command buffer that will be submitted immediately (note this will also flush
		 *							any other transfer buffer operations).
