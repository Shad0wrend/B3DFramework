	// TODO - Potential improvements:
	//  - I will probably want to extract a generalized Serializer class so we can re-use the code in text or other serializers
	//  - Encode does a chunk-based encode so that we don't need to know the buffer size in advance, and don't have to use
	//    a lot of memory for the buffer. Consider doing something similar for decode.
	//  - Add a simple encode method that doesn't require a callback, instead it calls the callback internally and creates
	//    the buffer internally.
